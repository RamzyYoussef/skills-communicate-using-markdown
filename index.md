# 1. Working with Branches and Pull Requests

In this part of the course, we learned the essential GitHub workflow used in most collaborative projects.
First, we created a new branch, allowing us to make changes without affecting the main branch. This keeps the main project stable while we work on updates or experiments.

Next, we committed a file to our branch. Each commit represents a snapshot of our changes along with a message describing what we did. This helps track progress and understand the history of the project.

After that, we opened a pull request (PR). A pull request is a request to merge our changes back into the main branch. It provides a space for discussions, reviews, and feedback before the changes are accepted.

Finally, we merged the pull request, which approved and integrated our changes into the main project. This completed the full cycle of creating, editing, reviewing, and merging work on GitHub.

# 2. Working With Markdown: Headers, Images, Code Examples, and Task Lists

In this section, we practiced using Markdown to format content on GitHub.
We started by adding headers. To create a header, we add a # followed by a space in front of any text to make an H1 header.
We can also create additional headers using one to six # characters, each followed by a space, to adjust the header size. For example:

# (#) This is an `<h1>` header, which is the largest
## (##) This is an `<h2>` header 
###### (######) This is an `<h6>` header, which is the smallest 


Next, we added an image using Markdown image syntax. This allowed us to display pictures either from a URL or from files stored in the repository.

We continued by adding a code example, using backticks to format text as either an inline code snippet or a full code block. This is useful for explaining commands, programming concepts, or examples in documentation.

We also created a task list, which uses checkboxes to show progress or outline steps. Task lists are especially useful when creating project plans or organizing workflows.

At the end of the exercise, we again merged the pull request, applying our Markdown changes to the main branch and completing the workflow.

## Top 5 Takeaways / Commands / Learnings

### 1.Creating a Branch
Use a branch to work on changes without affecting the main project. This keeps your work organized and safe.

### 2.Committing Changes
A commit saves a snapshot of your work. Always write a clear commit message to describe what you changed.

### 3.Opening a Pull Request
A pull request lets others review your work and discuss changes before merging them into the main branch.

### 4.Using Markdown Effectively
Use headers (#), images, code blocks (` or ), and task lists (- [ ]) to format your content clearly on GitHub.

### 5.Merging a Pull Request
After review, merge your pull request to add your changes permanently to the main branch.
